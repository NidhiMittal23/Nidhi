To build new components:

1) If using sublime editor turn tabs into space
2) add component dependencies in index.html
  <script src="DocsApp/license/license.js"></script>
  <script src="DocsApp/license/license_controllers.js"></script>
  <script src="DocsApp/license/license_services.js"></script>
 
NOTE: make seperate controller and service as code looks structured

3) inject component(e.g. 'license') in 'myApp' module

4) based on requirement as Notification is only used in license-controller, inject dependencies likewise

5) put ng-model name of input field same as params to be send to endpoints, it gets easy to pass params.
